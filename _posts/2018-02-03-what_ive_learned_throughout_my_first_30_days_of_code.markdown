"So, after studying full-time for 5 months, do you feel like you've learned enough to work as a web developer?"

"Yes, but if anything, I think its taught me a lot more about myself." 

I started with Flatiron School's online Full Stack Web Development program just over a month ago. Here's what I've learned throughout my first 4 weeks: 

I knew learning to program without any previous experience was going to be difficult. But some days, it is DIFFICULT. There are study sessions that pass that I could have never prepared for. 

Do you know those days I’m taking about?

Those days that are spent on a lab or a lesson on a completely new concept. You hoped it would take 20 minutes to grasp; but then those 20  minutes turn into 40 minutes and those 40 minutes turn into 90 minutes and before you know it,  the sun is down, your dog is hangry and you forgot wtf the lesson was trying to teach in first place.

**Take Breaks and Take them Often**.
It’s amazing what 20 minutes of fresh air can do for a busy brain.  Apps like Be Focused which utilize the Pomodoro timer technique have helped me maintain my focus while reminding me to step away from the computer after 40 - 45 minute study intervals. 20 minutes away from the computer while eating a snack, taking a walk, or having a short casual phone call with a friend has helped to ease any anxieties and help me get back to work with a fresh mind. 

**Reiteration of Iteration **

Follow with me here:
```
thought_process = [“Huh”, “Wait, what?”, “Okay, I think I got it”, “OHHH I get it”, “WHOO!”]

def learn_something_challenging(thought_process)
	counter = 1
	thought_process.each do | progress |
		I studied this lesson #{counter} time(s) and I thought #{progress}.
	counter +=1
end 
```

 
The concept of Iteration haunted me for longer than I liked. Especially when it came to nested arrays and hashes. (Quite honestly, it actually still haunts me now that I think about it.) But every time I find some concept immensely challenging, I remind myself that the only way to actually learn it to is study and utilize it - over and over and over again. 

**Ask Questions & Get Involved**

What If I don’t want to read a lesson for the third time that day? Or what if my google searches don’t seem to be getting anywhere? During my first week, I was too embarrassed to ask for help. “What if thats a stupid question? Should this even be a question? Can I even pronounce ‘concatenation’?” ASK AWAY. Luckily for me, the Flatiron School has a supportive community that is available almost every hour of the day. I’ve learned to take advantage of the community resources via Slack, Study Groups and the Ask-A-Question feature on learn.io. These resources have shaved off hours of my learning curve. t’s been one of my most valuable lessons this month so if you find yourself with some similar struggles, I highly recommend!

Here’s to another month. Happy Coding!
