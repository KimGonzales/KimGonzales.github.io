> You were put on this earth to achieve your greatest self, to live out your purpose, and to do it courageously" - *Steve Maroboli*

<li><h5>Purpose: Doing Well & Being Good </h5></li>
<p>
In 2013, I fell in love with the world and the people in it.  I spent the year traveling internationally- meeting  incredible, intelligent, and humble individuals. They welcomed me with open arms, sharing their cultural experiences along the way. </p>

<p>The connectivity inspired me. It was then that I decided that I wanted to travel often. And if I could continue to learn and contribute positively to others while doing it - well, I would be living my dream. </p>

<p>Learning how to code allows for that.  There is *always* going to be something new to learn. As someone who focuses on self-improvement and growth, the thought of learning these new skills excites me - the new knowledge, the vastness of information, the challenges to overcome - bring it on!

<p>Not only does it seem rewarding to myself as an individual, learning to code provides the possiblity of using those skills to help build programs that can be beneficial to the world around us. Turns out in web development, you could even [re-create it](https://2050.earth/). </p>


<li><h5>Financial Security</h5></li>
<p>If I'm going to be traveling about, I'm going to need a bit of funds to get me there. A little bird once told me you could make a pretty penny working as a web developer. The average salary in New York is close to double what I was making at my last job. What is this magic?
</p>


<li><h5>Work Flexibility</h5></li>
<p>No really, what is this magic? In order to fulfill a job as a web developer (once trained and seasoned of course,) all someone would hypothetically need is a laptop and an internet connection. The rest is, essentially, preference. Web developers have the glorious choice of working for a company (large or small), or to work for themselves. </p>

</ol>

<p>All in all, I choose this path so I could design my life; To work with flexibility, financial security and to live with purpose.
</p> 


<p> Wish me luck!</p>
