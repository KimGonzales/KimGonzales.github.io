Four months ago I had no idea how the internet worked. This week, I’ve built my first ever Sinatra web application from scratch.

### The App: BrainFood
[Source Code](//https://github.com/KimGonzales/brainfood)

The benefits of reading include memory improvement, vocabulary expansion, stress reduction, and the reduction of the chances of developing Alzheimers. 

As student eager to connect with others through knowledge, I decided to dedicate my first web application to the advantageous activity of reading. 

Brainfood is a web app that utilizes the Model-View-Controller software architecture. It’s domain models are comprised of users, books and bookshelves.

Once a user logs in or signs up to the app, they are greeted with inspirational quotes from the most recent books posted. 

Users are able to catalog their most recent or favorite reads by creating new bookshelves and then adding books to them. They are also able to edit and update this information. As an added bonus, each user can browse other user Libraries for recommendations or inspiration.

It was a pleasure to build my first web application and the overall experience challenged my knowledge on forms, directory configuration and css. I'm looking forward to building the next one!
